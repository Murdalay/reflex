# Reflex

Model based web interfaces auto generator concept.

It uses Redux under the hood and implements unidirectional data flow concept. Initialy designed for use with the React `*VC` ecosystem. Could be extended for usage with other render engines as it's render agnostic.

It's written on Typescript.
Current state is pre-alpha. So, it's not recommended as the massive API changes will be performed.
